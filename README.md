# Bookie - React

A book management application built with [React 16](https://github.com/facebook/react)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Deploying

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

After that, run `npm run server` in another terminal or `nodemon server` in backend folder, depending on the database you want to use.

Note: axios link in components (especially login and register components) needs to be changed depending on the choosen database.

For JSON server, the link would be "localhost:3000".

For MongoDB, the link would be "localhost:5000".

Test account is **vu**, password is **2312**.

### Database

The "server" folder was created as test backend, data inside was generated automatically from Faker.js. It only served as a test database for the functions of JS frontend.

"server" backend was ran by json server for test phase.


The "backend" folder used MongoDB as its database and express.js as server. Cors package was used as a middleware.

Currently, MongoDB database is only connected with user and finishedBook model and relates to function: login, register and CRUD in finishedBook page.

The other page including droppedBook, currentBook and wishlistBook are using database from "server" folder, as an application example for json server, and also because they serve the same CRUD structure as finishedBook.


In conclusion, 2 different backend are used in this project for better learning experiences.

To use "server" backend, run:
`npm run server`

To use "backend" backend, run:
`nodemon server`
in backend folder.
